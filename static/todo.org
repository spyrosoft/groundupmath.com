* Bugs

** Make division statistics display properly


* Minimally Viable


* Feature Requests

** Create a visual representation of the problem

** If problems exist which haven't been displayed yet, generate them or those marked incorrect - otherwise tend to generate problems marked incorrect more frequently than others

** Make the prompt and answer font size fit on mobile


* Done

** Make a tree of possible solutions

** Display the statistics of which problems the user tends to get right

** When an answer begins to be typed in and is fewer characters than the answer, compare the characters one at a time starting at the front - mark the answer wrong if it doesn't match at any point

** Make radio buttons for displaying statistics - +, -, x, รท, and Automatic

** Only generate the statistics tree if statistics is visible

** Avoid generating the same problem twice in a row
	 If the same question is generated 1000 times in a row, it needs to be used to avoid an infinite loop
